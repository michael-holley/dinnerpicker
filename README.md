This is a simple python project to create a system to never have to decide on
what to eat again. You will be able to add different meals to your program and
over time you will have a collective of emals that it will randomly pull from.

You will be able to choose dinners for custom amounts of time as well. So if you
need to go shopping for the week, you can have the system pull 7 random meals.
I would also like to add filters to the results if you aren't feeling a
particular type of food.
